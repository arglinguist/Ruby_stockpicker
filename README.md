# Ruby_stockpicker
Mini-project for The Odin Project's Ruby curriculum -- compares the values of stock prices in an array and returns the best day to buy and sell with the given prices.
## Challenges/Discoveries
Started with an attempt at somewhat recursive approach, calling a function to analyze potential sell prices for every previous buy price, but this was going to be long and more complex than necessary.
Using #each_with_index instead simplified.
## Further Development
- Allow user to input values of stocks to generate array
